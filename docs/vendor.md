# Pinned dependency map

Treat `vendor/` as read-only implementation source, not a browsing task. Start from an owned import,
follow the exact symbol into one tree, and stop when the relevant contract is understood. Exact
upstream repositories and revisions live in `vendor.lock.json`.

| Tree | What it owns | Useful entry points | Why it is present |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `v4-core` | PoolManager, hook interfaces, pool types, delta and settlement rules | `src/PoolManager.sol`, `src/interfaces/IHooks.sol`, `src/libraries/Hooks.sol`, `src/types/` | Protocol implementation and real callback semantics |
| `v4-periphery` | BaseHook, PositionManager, routers, actions and hook address mining | `src/utils/BaseHook.sol`, `src/utils/HookMiner.sol`, `src/PositionManager.sol`, `src/libraries/Actions.sol` | Production hook base and canonical integration surfaces |
| `openzeppelin-contracts` | ERC-20, ERC-721 and audited utility/security bases | `contracts/token/`, then the exact imported utility | Companion token/NFT implementation |
| `chainlink-evm` | Minimal VRF v2.5 wrapper consumer closure for native direct funding | `contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFV2PlusWrapperConsumerBase.sol`, `PROVENANCE.md` | Compiling direct-funding reference without a large dependency tree |
| `forge-std` | Foundry test, script, cheatcode and invariant utilities | `src/Test.sol`, `src/Script.sol`, `src/StdInvariant.sol` | Local tests and deployment scripts |
| `permit2` | Permit2 interfaces and implementation used by v4 periphery | follow the exact import from `v4-periphery` | Transitive PositionManager/router approval dependency |
| `solmate` | Lightweight token and utility contracts used transitively by pinned Uniswap code | follow the exact import from `v4-core`, `v4-periphery` or a fixture | Transitive compile/test dependency |

`test/utils/v4hook-testkit/` is project test infrastructure rather than a general dependency tree.
Its Solidity sources expose the real pinned PoolManager/PositionManager fixture. Files under
`test/utils/v4hook-testkit/artifacts/` contain deployment bytecode and are not source-reading targets.

## Updating a dependency

Update only when the task requires it. Record the upstream repository and immutable revision in
`vendor.lock.json`; update any tree-specific provenance file; inspect the diff for unexpected files;
then rerun formatting, build, real PoolManager integration tests and the full check. Never mix
independent dependency upgrades into a hook feature change.
