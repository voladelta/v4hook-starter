# Viem dapp integration

The dapp consumes one generated deployment manifest rather than duplicating addresses in source.
`ui/public/deployment.example.json` documents the browser schema;
`deployments/sepolia.example.json` shows testnet inputs. Deployment writes the ignored
`ui/public/deployment.json`, and devnet shutdown removes it so verification remains clean.

## Boundary

- Verify the wallet chain before reads, simulations or writes.
- Read contract addresses and pool parameters from the manifest.
- Parse and format token amounts with each token's decimals; validate address input and render
  addresses in a copyable, explorer-linked form.
- Use the product's intended router. Universal Router flows bind Permit2 approvals, deadlines,
  recipients and hook data explicitly.
- Treat emitted events as indexing hints; read authoritative balances and claim state from contracts.

## Transaction flow

Model each write as one serialized state machine: connect, switch chain, approve, execute, then
confirm. Present only the next valid action. Each action owns its pending state and disables its
trigger immediately. Rejection or failure returns to an actionable state; confirmation advances
only after authoritative state has refreshed.

Before requesting a signature, simulate the production entry point and present the exact token,
native value and slippage effects. After submission, poll for the receipt, refetch authoritative
state and derive success from receipt status plus product postconditions. Translate wallet, RPC and
decoded contract failures into an actionable message while retaining diagnostic detail.

Treat RPC reads as fallible: expose unavailable or stale state, bound receipt polling and retry
idempotent reads through a deliberate fallback. A transaction hash is progress, not completion.

`ui/` is deliberately small: wallet connection, manifest loading and status display. The product
agent adds hook-specific reads and actions after contract interfaces stabilize. Keep private keys
out of the browser and repository.

The dapp boundary is complete when every supported write uses its production entry point, routed
swaps use the intended router, the transaction state machine exposes no conflicting actions,
simulation and wallet chain checks precede approval, receipt status and product postconditions
determine success, and no address or pool parameter is duplicated outside the manifest.
