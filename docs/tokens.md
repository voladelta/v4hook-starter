# Companion ERC-20 and NFT

Delete unused seed contracts. When a companion is required, extend the pinned OpenZeppelin base and
keep custom behavior narrow.

## ERC-20

Choose supply once: fixed constructor mint, bounded emission, or explicit mint authority. Avoid
combining several policies. Specify recipient, cap, burn behavior, transfer hooks and recovery. Test
total supply, zero-address boundaries and every custom authority; OpenZeppelin's ordinary transfer
behavior does not need to be retested.

`src/tokens/StarterToken.sol` demonstrates an immutable fixed supply with no owner or later mint.

## ERC-721

Choose who mints, how token IDs advance, whether metadata can change and whether transfers affect
hook accounting. If ownership represents a claim, test transfer, burn and recovery together with
the hook liability.

`src/tokens/StarterNft.sol` demonstrates one immutable minter and sequential IDs. Replace its policy
when the product requires permissionless minting, capped issuance, signatures or hook-only minting.

Pinned bases live under `vendor/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/`.
