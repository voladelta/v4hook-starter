# Agent guide

Deliver the requested hook as a vertical product through every surface it needs: contracts, real
PoolManager proof, deployment, devnet interaction, and dapp integration. Remove unused seed
components so the finished repository describes one product.

## Choose the workflow

- **Focused edit:** inspect the owning surface, make the smallest coherent change, and run its
  nearest proof.
- **Multi-surface build:** read the installed `workflow-convergence` skill, then
  `docs/workflow.md`. Let that skill decide whether the request needs one compact `task-contracts`
  contract; an already-checkable request does not need another specification.
- **Repository change:** apply `implement-repo-changes` as production-path hygiene, subordinate to
  this guide and any task contract.
- **Material review:** after focused proof is green, follow `docs/workflow.md` with
  `maintaining-llm-prs` when a change alters architecture, APIs, invariants, security, persistence,
  concurrency, or several product surfaces.

This repository is standalone. Use its source and scripts directly; the legacy `v4hook-cli` is not
part of this workflow.

## Route the task

Open only the smallest owned surface that can answer the request. Read `README.md` for starter
orientation or its copy workflow, `foundry.toml` for Solidity build or test behavior, and
`remappings.txt` when tracing an import. Generated evidence lives in `out/`, `cache/`, `broadcast/`,
`.devnet/`, and `reports/`; treat it as output rather than source.

| Trigger | Read first | Disclose next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hook callbacks, permissions, or deltas | `src/StarterHook.sol` and its exact pinned imports | `docs/hook.md`, then `docs/security.md` |
| Authenticated native/token swaps | `src/router/AuthenticatedNativeTokenRouter.sol` and its integration test | `docs/hook.md` |
| ERC-20 or NFT companion | `src/tokens/` and the exact OpenZeppelin base | `docs/tokens.md` |
| PoolManager, fuzz, or invariant proof | `test/integration/` or the affected test | `docs/testing.md` |
| Loops, batches, cohorts, or storage growth | the public entry point and its maximum bound | `docs/gas.md` |
| Chainlink randomness | `src/vrf/` and the exact pinned Chainlink base | `docs/vrf.md` |
| Browser or Viem behavior | `ui/` and `deployments/` | `docs/dapp.md` |
| One hundred local traders | `scenarios/` and `scripts/devnet-*` | `docs/devnet.md` |
| Testnet preparation or deployment | `script/` and `scripts/testnet-*` | `docs/testnet.md` |
| Dependency source, provenance, or upgrade | the owned import and `remappings.txt` | `docs/vendor.md` |
| Foundry flags, failures, or configuration | installed `forge --version` and exact `--help` | `references/foundry/README.md` |

Search a pinned dependency only from a known owned import and exact symbol. `vendor/` is read-only;
`docs/vendor.md` owns its map and upgrade procedure. Testkit artifact files are opaque bytecode, not
source-reading targets.

## Preserve product invariants

- Use inherited PoolManager-only callback entry points and enable only callbacks the product uses.
- Bind payer, recipient, or beneficiary identity at an authenticated settlement boundary; callback
  `sender` alone is not user identity.
- Reconcile every return delta, token movement, claim, remainder, and liability through the real
  PoolManager path.
- Keep contract interfaces, deployment scripts, manifests, scenarios, and UI consumers synchronized.
- Gate any user-callable work that grows with inputs or storage through `docs/gas.md` before
  expanding downstream surfaces.

The routed document owns branch-specific requirements for swaps, tokens, VRF, tests, devnet, and
testnet. Apply every requirement on each branch the product includes.

## Verify

Use `docs/testing.md` for focused and full local proof. An interactive product also completes the
devnet gate in `docs/devnet.md`. Testnet preparation and its broadcast boundary live in
`docs/testnet.md`.

## Authority

Build requests authorize local source edits, tests, generated local manifests, and disposable
localhost processes. Signing, wallet access, paid services, public-network broadcast, verification
publication, dependency installation, and external repository writes require explicit user
authority. Keep secrets out of commands, output, files, and prompts; a user-run broadcast may name
an existing Foundry keystore account.

## Completion

Complete means the requested behavior exists through its production path, every applicable routed
requirement and gate is satisfied, unused seed references are removed or classified, interactive
products have devnet evidence, and remaining external actions are reported without being performed.
